In this project I am going to create a calculator using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

I will be using this file as my structure sheet, so I might add and remove information out of this file.
That being said, let's go!


    Step 1:
        Create functions for the four basic math operators:
            - add
            - substract
            - multiplay
            - divide
    
    Step 2:
        Create var for firstNum, operator, secondNum:
            - firstNum
            - operator
            - secondNum
    
    Step 3:
        Create operate function that takes an operator, 2 nums and calls a math function:
            - function operate()

    Step 4:
        Create HTML-Calculator Layout:
            - Calcultaor-Container
            - Display
            - Number-Buttons (0 - 9)
            - Equal-Button (=)
            - Operator-Buttons (+, -, /, *)
            - All-Clear-Buttom (AC)
            - Comma-Button (,)
            - Delete-Button (Del)
